💻 Built a School Management System in Python with Tkinter &amp; SQLite3 — managing students, classes, and data with an intuitive interface!


🚀 School Management System Project

I developed a desktop application using Python (Tkinter + SQLite3) to manage students and classes in a simple and efficient way.

🔹 Key Features:

Create and manage classes dynamically.

Register students with details such as name, gender, age, and average grade.

Assign students to specific classes.

Search functionality to filter students by name or class.

Intuitive interface designed to make data visualization easy and clear.

This project demonstrates my skills in:
✅ Python development (Tkinter for GUI, SQLite3 for database management)
✅ Designing user-friendly interfaces
✅ Handling CRUD operations efficiently
✅ Building scalable and practical solutions

📌 I created this project as part of my journey to strengthen my skills in software development and database-driven applications, aiming to bring real-world solutions to educational contexts.
